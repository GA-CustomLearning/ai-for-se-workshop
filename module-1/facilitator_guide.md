# 🟢 Module 1: Introduction to AI for Software Development - 📄 Participant Handout

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:  
✅ Understand how LLMs process text in tokens and why it matters.  
✅ Compare outputs from different AI models to make better workflow decisions.  
✅ Apply practical techniques to reduce token usage and optimize cost.

## 🔥 Activity 1: Token Counting

### 📌 Purpose
Learn how to analyze token usage in your code and understand its impact on API cost and performance.

### ⚙️ Tools You’ll Need
- [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)  
- [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing)

### 📝 Instructions
1. Open the OpenAI Tokenizer in your browser.  
2. Choose one of the provided sample files:  
   - Small function (~50 tokens)  
   - Medium API doc (~800 tokens)  
   - Large project file (~3000 tokens) (or use a file from your own project)  
3. Paste your selected file into the tokenizer.  
4. Record the token count.  
5. Visit OpenAI Pricing and calculate approximate costs for:  
   - GPT-3.5 ($0.0015 per 1K tokens)  
   - GPT-4x ($0.03 per 1K tokens)  
6. Reflect: Where in your workflow might token usage be reduced?

### ✅ Record Your Findings

| File Used          | Token Count | GPT-3.5 Cost | GPT-4x Cost |
