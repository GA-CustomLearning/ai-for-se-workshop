### 🛠 Learner Activity (50 min)

#### 💻 Hands-On
- Repo provided with mirrored exercise files
- Autocomplete:
  - New vs existing files (compare results)
- Chat:
  - Refactor single files
  - Use JSDoc/comments for declarative function names
- Agent Mode:
  - Build a CLI program (Task Tracker with File I/O and CRUD):
    - Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
    - Use file I/O (e.g., JSON or plain text file) to persist task data.
    - `core.ts`: Contains the main CLI logic for handling commands.
    - `storage.ts`: Manages reading from and writing to the task data file.
  - 🚀 Stretch: Add tests for the CLI program.
- Encourage learners to explore and experiment freely.

---

### 💬 Discussion (15 min)
Lead a reflection on:  
- When autocomplete works best (context-rich files)  
- Strengths and weaknesses of chat and agent modes  
- Real-world use cases for each mode

---

## 📌 Key Talking Points
- Productivity gains: faster feature development, reduced boilerplate
- Cognitive relief: engineers focus on solving complex problems
- ROI: speed + reduced mental load
- Emotional Safety: developers feel empowered, not replaced

## 🎯 Outcomes
Participants will:  
✅ Set up Copilot & Cursor successfully  
✅ Use @ references, chat, and agent modes in real exercises  
✅ Compare interaction patterns and identify best-fit workflows  
✅ Leave confident in applying AI pair programming day-t
