### 🛠 Learner Activity (50 min)

#### 📝 Exercises (Mirrored Repo)
- **Autocomplete**  
  - Try in a new file (note: limited context)  
  - Try in an existing file (better results with context)  
- **Chat Mode**  
  - Dissect declarative function/class names using JSDoc/comments  
  - Chat to refine or generate single-file solutions  
- **Agent Mode**  
  - Build a small CLI program (Task Tracker with File I/O and CRUD):
    - Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
    - Use file I/O (e.g., JSON or plain text file) to persist task data.
    - `core.ts`: Contains the main CLI logic for handling commands.
    - `storage.ts`: Manages reading from and writing to the task data file.
  - 🚀 *Stretch*: Add testing to the CLI program.
